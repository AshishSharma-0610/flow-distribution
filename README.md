# Flow Distribution Algorithm 

## Project Overview

This project implements a flow distribution algorithm for connecting users with astrologers. The system is designed to fairly distribute users among available astrologers while respecting user preferences and accommodating adjustments for top-performing astrologers.

Key features:
- Fair distribution of users to astrologers
- Respect for user preferences when possible
- Adjustable flow for top-performing astrologers
- Efficient handling of large numbers of users and astrologers
- RESTful API for interacting with the system
